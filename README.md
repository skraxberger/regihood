# regihood
This is the development branch of a social market place intended for regial direct marketing. It is developed using Node.js, Express, AngularJS, and MongoDB (custom MEAN stack). 

# Motivation
We want to allow small farmers, producers and makers to interact directly with possible customers using aspects of social media. Therefore, we are developing an open source platform for direct marketing of regional products. 

This platform will provide the following features.
- Authentication using social (Facebook and Google) and local login (Username, Password)
- News stream which is visible by all users but can be customized using follow, like and share
- Static and dynamic groups for structuring information outside of the general stream
- Private messages and chat between users
- Profiles with cover and profile images for normal users and makers
- Simple online shops for makers
- Responsive design for usage of the homepage on different devices

# Installation

	npm install
	bower install
